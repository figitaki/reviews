# Changelog

All notable changes to Reviews will be tracked here.

Reviews uses semver with prerelease tags while the CLI and hosted service are
still stabilizing.

## [0.0.1-alpha.2] - 2026-05-21

Supersedes `0.0.1-alpha.1`, whose release build never published — its CLI
release workflow stalled on a retired macOS Intel runner. This release carries
the same changes plus the CI fix.

### Added

- New homepage with a CTA-driven walkthrough that demonstrates the review
  workflow.
- Packet outline tree navigation for moving through review packet sections.

### Changed

- CLI Linux release artifacts are now statically linked against musl
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` / `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`). This removes
  the glibc version dependency, so the binary runs on older distros such as
  Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 11, RHEL 8, and Amazon Linux 2 without the
  `GLIBC_2.xx not found` runtime error.
- Improved the changes view with better expansion behavior and file tree.
- The diff renderer was migrated from React to a vanilla implementation.
- Production now runs on the `reviews.figitaki.dev` custom domain; the legacy
  `reviews-dev.fly.dev` hostname 301-redirects to it.

### Fixed

- The CLI release workflow now cross-compiles the macOS x64 build on an Apple
  Silicon runner instead of the retired `macos-13` Intel runner, which had been
  blocking release publication.

## [0.0.1-alpha.0] - 2026-05-19

Initial alpha baseline.

### Added

- Phoenix + LiveView web app for link-based review pages.
- Rust `reviews` CLI for pushing arbitrary git diffs into Reviews.
- GitHub OAuth sign-in, API token minting, and authenticated CLI access.
- Patchset history via `reviews push --update <slug>`.
- Draft review comments that can be published as a batch.
- Content-aware thread anchoring for carrying comments across patchsets.
- Section-aware review packet support for agent-authored review context.
- Demo review seeded for hosted and local installs.

### Notes

- The intended first release tags are `cli-v0.0.1-alpha.0` and
  `server-v0.0.1-alpha.0`.
- Syntax highlighting is still plain-text in this alpha.
- Token-range comments are intentionally deferred; the schema discriminator and
  relocation stub remain in place for a later v1.5-style pass.
